# MemeMe

### Tech Used
* Xcode 7.3.1
* Swift 2.2
*iOS 9.2 Frameworks:
* Foundation
* UIKit

### Description
User selects image from camera or photo album, adds text, then can share as a meme via the "usual" Apple sharing methods.
Images are saved for the current session only (closing the app removes the images from memory). However, via sharing, users can save the images to their photo album or other locations.
During the current session, users can see their created memes in a table view or a collection view, via a tab bar controller.
